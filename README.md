# ThirdPersonPlatformerLab3
 
##Implemented functionality
- All the basic stuff (free look camera, basic movement, jumping, rotation with the camera and player faced forward, boxes to jump onto and invisible walls)
- Added down gravity for a more weighty less floaty jump. And also added variable height jumps depending on how long you hold space bar.
- Bonus: Also added Dash (shift) and double jump (spacebar while in the air)
